## Description

I set out to create a site to create and store blog posts utilizing local storage, arrays, and objects all while using JS, CSS, and HTML.
This site also has a light/ dark mode toggle. I learned tons about local storage and how to properly use it and how to better use JavaScript (JS), CSS, and HTML in tandem with each  other.
